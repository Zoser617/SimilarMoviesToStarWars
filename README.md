# SimilarMoviesToStarWars
This program is a basic movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies to Star Wars (1977) based on user ratings.
It uses a dataset of movie ratings by users and another dataset of movie titles to create a table of movie ratings. 
The table is then used to calculate the similarity of each movie to Star Wars (1977). 
The most similar movies are then displayed based on the number of ratings they received and their average rating score.
I coded the program via Jupyter Notebook
